In this folder might go work that the team is producing while they're iterating against the report. However, at the time that you deliver your repository: 

1. You should take out this note to tell us what is _actually_ in this folder.
2. You should have cleaned up this part of the repository so that what is here is useful to the reader. There shouldn't be anything at the top level, on the `main` branch that is "work in progress". If you want to keep that around, you can but... (a) you're not going to come back to it; (b) it is important to be able to "kill your darlings" and edit things that you once thought but do not any more; and, (c) we'll say it again... you're probably not going to come back to some pile of files.
